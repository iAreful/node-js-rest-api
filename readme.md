# Vanilla Node REST API

> Full CRUD REST API using Node.js with no framework

This is for learning/experimental purposes. In most cases, you would use something like Express in a production project

```
# Routes
GET      /api/products
POST     /api/products
GET      /api/products/:id
PUT      /api/products/:id
DELETE   /api/products/:id

```

## Usage

```
# Install dependencies
npm install
yarn install

# Run in develpment
npm run dev
yarn run dev

# Run in production
npm start
yarn start
```

Feel free to add to this and create a PR. I plan on creating a better router, but if you'd like to do that, feel free
